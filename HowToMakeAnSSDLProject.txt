To create a project that works with the SSDL library:

Copy the basicSSDLProject folder in the newWork subfolder and rename it appropriately. 
*Keep it in this newWork folder so the relative paths to the include and library directories still work.* 
Go into your new folder.

Then,

With MinGW:  
Copy Makefile.mingw to Makefile, and type make.
To run, type bash mingw

In Unix:
Copy Makefile.unix to Makefile, and type make.
To run, type ./runx

With Microsoft Visual Studio:
Open SSDL_Project.sln, build, and run.
